# stock-analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve make informed decisions in the stock market regarding a particular set of stocks.

## Results
The stock that Steve's parents chose was not a strong performer in the market, they would be better off choosing a different stock to invest in, like ENPH, which had the strongest performance of the group out of both 2017 and 2018.

## Summary
1. The refactored code ran faster than the non-refactored code. 
2. This was a tedious and sometimes confusing process, but will likely make it easier for other people to interact with this code by simplifying it. Saving time on fractions of a second isn't practically useful, so this would be a stronger reason for doing so.
